## Exercises ##

1. Implement an image processing filter of your choice. This can be anything **not**
done in class; you're not graded on whether or not it should be incorporated in
the next version of Photoshop. Incorporate it in the ImageProcessing.java file we
looked at in class, thoroughly documented with what it's doing and how. Include a
snapshot of the result of applying your filter.

2. What happens when you change the sharpen() method so that only *n* times the
pixel's own value is added in, rather than *n+1* times? Explain why.

## Submission Instructions ##

Turn in your revised ImageProcessing.java (with your filter clearly marked), the
snapshot of your processed image, and a document with your answers to the questions.
