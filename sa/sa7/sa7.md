## Exercises ##

1. Write a method to produce a copy of a stack, leaving the input stack in its
   original state (though it won't always be in that state during the method...).
   The method should only depend on the <code>SimpleStack</code> interface (i.e.,
   pushing, popping, and testing emptiness), not any implementation details.
   Thus it's a static method in [StackTest.java](resources/StackTest.java).
   (Note that the generic type has to be declared as part of the static method,
   just as it's declared part of the original interface and implementation.)
   It should not need any data types other than stacks.

2. Illustrate the construction of a max heap (i.e., calling <code>buildMaxHeap</code>)
   from the array <code>[2,5,16,4,10,23,39,18,26,15]</code>. You don't have to
   draw the tree, but just show the array at each step (copy &amp; paste and modify).
   (You probably want to keep the tree in your head, and even on paper, but you don't
   have to go to the effort of drawing it with the graphical editor of your choice.)

## Submission Instructions ##

Turn in your completed stack code and your written answer to the heap question.
