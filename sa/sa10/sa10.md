## Exercises ##

[based on GTG 11.22] Consider the sequence of keys

```
5, 16, 22, 45, 2, 10, 18, 30, 50, 12, 1
```

Draw the result of inserting entries with these keys (in the given order) into

1. an initially empty 2-3-4 tree
2. an initially empty red-black tree
3. an initially empty skip list (and also list the results of your coin flips)

You need not show all the steps along the way (though you might find it helpful
for "debugging" if you do).

## Submission Instructions ##
